\noindent 7: B, D, E, F, G

\begin{itemize}
\item[7B]

	Prove Theorem 7.7 (Existence and uniqueness of perpendicular bisectors)

	Theorem 7.7: Every segment has a unique perpendicular bisector

\item[7D]

	Prove Theorem 7.10 (Existence and uniqueness of a reflected point)

	Theorem 7.10: Let $\ell$ be a line and let $A$ be a point not on $\ell$. Then there is a unique point $A'$, called the reflection of $A$ across $\ell$, such that $\ell$ is hte perpendicular bisector of $\segment{AA'}$.

\item[7E]

	Prove Lemma 7.12 (Properties of closest points)

	Let $P$ be a point and let $S$ be any set of points.

		a) If $C$ is a closest point to $P$ in $S$, then $C' \in S$ is also a closest point to $P$ if and only if $PC' = PC$

		b) If $C$ is a point in $S$ such that $PX > PC$ for every point $X \in S$ other than $C$, then $C$ ius the unique closest point to $P$ in $S$.

\item[7F]

	Prove Theorem 7.13 (The closest point on a line)

	Suppose $\ell$ is a line, $P$ is a point not on $\ell$, and $F$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $P$ to $\ell$ 

	a) $F$ is the unique closest point to $P$ on $\ell$

	b) If $A, B$ are points on $\ell$ such that $F * A * B$, then $PB > PA$

\item[7G]

	Prove theorem 7.14 (The lcosest point on a segment) [Hint: consider separately the cases in which $P\in \lines{AB}$ and $P\not\in \lines{AB}$, and divide the second case into two subcases depending on whether the foot of the perpendicular from $P$ to $\lines{AB}$ does or does not lie in $\segment{AB}$].

	Theorem 7.14: Suppose $\lines{AB}$ is a segment and $P$ is any point. Then there is a unique closest point to $P$ in $\lines{AB}$
